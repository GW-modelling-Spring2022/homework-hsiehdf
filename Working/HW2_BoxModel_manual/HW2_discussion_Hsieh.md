# Glossary Questions

### What is MODFLOW? What is a MODFLOW package (provide at least 2 examples)? What are the inputs to a MODFLOW model?
* Modflow is a groundwater model that can calculate flux of water in a predescribed system. A modflow package is a used to specify non-spatial inputs. An example is the Horizontal flow barrier package and the Layer property flow package. An input to Modflow is a paramter we give it. 

### What is the relationship between head gradients and hydraulic conductivity in steady state systems?
* They are inversely related

### What is a model node? A model cell? Use a simple diagram to show the relationship between heads defined at nodes and properties defined in cells.
* A model node is a point within a model cell. When we calculated the heads in our models it was at the model node, which was located at the center of our model cell. 

### What is the difference between TypeI and Type II boundary conditions and under what conditions might you use each? Provide at least 2 examples for locations where we might use Type I or Type II boundaries to represent a feature in the real world.
* Type 1 boundary condition = specified head
* Type 2 boundary condition = specified flow
* I would use a constant head if I was interested in infiltration under a body of water that was not changing height.
* I would use a constant flow if I was trying to model a rain event with very steady precipitation rate.
